# About the Standard

<img src="images/owasp_mas_header.png" width="100%" />

The OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) is the industry standard for mobile application security. It provides a comprehensive set of security controls that can be used to assess the security of mobile apps across various platforms (e.g., Android, iOS) and deployment scenarios (e.g., consumer, enterprise). The standard covers the key components of the mobile app attack surface including storage, cryptography, authentication and authorization, network communication, interaction with the mobile platform, code quality and resilience against reverse engineering and tampering.

The OWASP MASVS is the result of years of community effort and industry feedback. We thank all the contributors who have helped shape this standard. We welcome your feedback on the OWASP MASVS at any time, especially as you apply it to your own organization and mobile app development projects. Getting inputs from a variety of mobile app developers will help us improve and update the standard which is revised periodically based on your inputs and feedback.

You can provide feedback using GitHub Discussions in the OWASP MASVS repo <https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/discussions>, or contact the project leads directly <https://mas.owasp.org/contact/>.

The OWASP MASVS and MASTG are trusted by the following platform providers and standardization, governmental and educational institutions. [Learn more](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/Intro/0x02b-MASVS-MASTG-Adoption/).

## Donators

While both the MASVS and the MASTG are created and maintained by the community on a voluntary basis, sometimes outside help is required. We therefore thank our donators for providing the funds to be able to hire technical editors. Note that their donation does not influence the content of the MASVS or MASTG in any way. The Donation Packages are described on the [OWASP MAS Website](https://mas.owasp.org/donate/packages/).
